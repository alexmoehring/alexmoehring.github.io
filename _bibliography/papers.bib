  abstract={Social distancing is the core policy response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). But, as federal, state and local governments begin opening businesses and relaxing shelter-in-place orders worldwide, we lack quantitative evidence on how policies in one region affect mobility and social distancing in other regions and the consequences of uncoordinated regional policies adopted in the presence of such spillovers. To investigate this concern, we combined daily, county-level data on shelter-in-place policies with movement data from over 27 million mobile devices, social network connections among over 220 million Facebook users, daily temperature and precipitation data from 62,000 weather stations, and county-level census data on population demographics to estimate the geographic and social network spillovers created by regional policies across the United States. Our analysis shows that the contact patterns of people in a given region are significantly influenced by the policies and behaviors of people in other, sometimes distant, regions. When just one-third of a state’s social and geographic peer states adopt shelter-in-place policies, it creates a reduction in mobility equal to the state’s own policy decisions. These spillovers are mediated by peer travel and distancing behaviors in those states. A simple analytical model calibrated with our empirical estimates demonstrated that the “loss from anarchy” in uncoordinated state policies is increasing in the number of noncooperating states and the size of social and geographic spillovers. These results suggest a substantial cost of uncoordinated government responses to COVID-19 when people, ideas, and media move across borders.}

  abstract={We study how the introduction of a new non-personalized news feed impacts user engagement quantity, quality, and diversity on Reddit. In June 2018, Reddit introduced the News tab on iOS devices that surfaces popular content from a curated list of news-related communities. We leverage this natural experiment to identify the causal effects of the News tab on iOS user engagement in a difference-in-differences design. We find that the News tab increases the share of iOS devices that engage with news-related content and the new engagement is not meaningfully different in quality from existing engagement. Additionally, we find that the diversity of engagement within news categories and within articles from publishers across the political spectrum increases as a result of the News tab. These results suggest that non-personalized feeds can be an important tool to mitigate algorithmic filter bubbles.}

  title={Personalized Rankings and User Engagement: An Empirical Evaluation of the Reddit News Feed},
  author={Moehring, Alex},
  year={2023},

  group={Working Paper},
  abstract={Digital platforms increasingly curate their content through personalized algorithmic rankings. Given the limited attention of their users and reliance on advertising, platforms have an incentive to promote content that increases the predicted engagement of each user. However, managers must also balance maximizing total engagement with the quality of content promoted on the platform due to advertiser concerns over brand safety and to satisfy policymakers. This paper studies how maximizing engagement for each user affects the quality of content with which users engage to understand the extent to which engagement-maximizing algorithms promote and incentivize low-quality content. In addition, I evaluate how the ranking algorithm itself can be designed to promote and encourage engagement with high quality content. To do this, I study the Reddit politics community and exploit a novel discontinuity – revealed in Reddit’s code repository – in how the ranking algorithm orders posts to identify the effect of a post’s rank on the number of comments it receives. I use this discontinuity to identify a discrete choice model of user comment decisions and estimate the distribution of news that users are exposed to and comment on under a personalized algorithm that maximizes engagement. This counterfactual demonstrates that personalization drives a wedge between users in terms of the quality of content – the credibility rating of an article’s publisher – with which are exposed and engage. Under the personalized ranking algorithm, users who ordinarily engage with high-credibility publishers continue to do so. However, users who ordinarily engage with lower-credibility publishers are exposed to and engage with an even larger share of low-credibility publishers under the personalized engagement-maximizing algorithm. Finally, I evaluate a credibility-aware algorithm that explicitly promotes credible news publishers and find that moving to the credibility-maximizing algorithm reduces total engagement by 5.0%, a meaningful decline. Yet, platforms can increase the share of the average user’s engagement with high-credibility publishers by 6.8 percentage points for only a 2.0% decrease in engagement. These findings suggest that algorithmic interventions can be a useful tool to promote higher-quality content to help satisfy both advertisers and policy makers.}

  title={Social Influence and News Consumption},
  author={Moehring, Alex and Molina, Carlos},

  abstract={Populations in several countries have become decidedly more polarized over the last decades. Many believe that social media, which facilitates interactions within echo chambers, is partly to blame. These interactions can trigger two distinct effects on the demand for biased news. First, individuals could be influenced by the news consumption of their peers, for example, because they value keeping an ideologically congruent news diet with their peers. Second, individuals might purposefully skew their news consumption preferences, anticipating that their choices will be observed by their peers. We design a field experiment on Twitter to separately identify the importance of both mechanisms. Our experiment induces variation in both an individual's perceptions of the political leanings of their peers’ news consumption and the visibility of their own news preferences to their social media followers. We track participants’ sharing behavior and news consumption, proxied by the news outlets that the participants follow. Our main result is that participants alter their news diet when they believe these choices will be observed by their peers, as in the second channel above. We find that individuals primarily value presenting themselves as following a balanced set of news which attenuates the demand for biased news. In contrast, we do not find evidence in favor of the first channel: our experimental variation does influence beliefs about the news diets of their peers but participants do not respond by changing their own news diets. In sum, we find little evidence supporting the hypothesis that, at least through the lenses of these two mechanisms, online interactions with like-minded people are a major contributor to the demand for polarized news content. Instead, our paper uncovers one mechanism for which we should expect the opposite: as social media platforms amplify the visibility of user interactions, the importance of social image concerns increases and, as a result, users adjust their news consumption to be more balanced}
