I am an assistant professor at the Daniels School of Business 
at Purdue University. My research focuses on the economics of digitization
with an emphasis on digital platforms, Human-AI interaction,
and social influence. 

I hold a PhD from the MIT Sloan
School of Management in addition to a BS in Business Administration 
and BA in Economics from the University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill. I have also worked as a research assistant at 
Microsoft Research and an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.
