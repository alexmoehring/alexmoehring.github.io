I'm a PhD candidate in Management Science at the MIT Sloan School 
of Management. My research focuses on the economics of digitization
with an emphasis on content platforms, social influence,
and Human-AI interaction. 

Prior to graduate school, I was a research assistant at 
Microsoft Research and an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.
I hold an SM in Management Research from the MIT Sloan
School of Management in addition to a BS in Business Administration 
and BA in Economics from the University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill.
